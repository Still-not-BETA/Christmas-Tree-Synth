# Christmas-Tree-Synth
A small Christmas Tree hanger with a built in Synth and Sequencer.
This is a small Baby 8 style Sequencer built up around a cd4017 CMOS Chip. It runs a VCO from a cd40106 and gets it's clock from another Oscillator built with the cd40106. You can control the tempo, and the pitch from each of the steps. You also got some LEDs that show the step and the tempo. It's all designed like a christmas tree and you could hang it on one :)
